Computer Basics 
- CPU (Central Processing Unit) 
    - Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) 
        - Performs arithmetic & logical operations 
    - Control Unit (CU) 
        - Extracts instructions from memory to decode and execute them 
    - Registers 
        - Small amount of memory available to CPU that is part of it
        - Much faster than main memory 
    - Cache 
        - Modern CPUs use cache memory to reduce average time to access data from main memory 
        - Different types of cache L1, L2, L3, L4
